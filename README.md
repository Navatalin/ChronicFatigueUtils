# Chronic Fatigue Utils

This application is a set of small utlities that are aimed to assist people with chronic fatigue.

The current utility is a simple tracking page where a user can input a task, how long it took them, how they felt after and if they were able to recover from that task.

This application is intended to be run as a docker container with a MongoDB backend for data persistance.
